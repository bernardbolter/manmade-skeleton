      <h3>Mike Grinser / Michael Kuhn</h3>
      <h5>Engineer</h5>
      <p>Mike began his journey into music in the mid 90’s as an electronic music artist with countless releases and tours under his belt. After his studies in audio school Mike joined the MMM team in 2008. To date he has been mastering and cutting some of the most prolific electronic music labels in the industry. His meticulous and borderline perfectionist analog processing is sought out by many. His skill set as a cutting engineer is superior as he was initially taught how to transcribe music to master-disc on the vintage Scully/Westrex system, now on a fully modded Neumann VMS70. When Mike is not in the mastering studio he gives back to the audio community by teaching in depth audio classes at SAE audio school.</p>
